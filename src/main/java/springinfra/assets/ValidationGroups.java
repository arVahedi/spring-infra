     * otherwise it's a insert operation and the group should set to {@link InsertValidationGroup}.
     * It can be used for validating inner crud object of another nested curd object. Imagine class User and Credential. Each credential object has an inner user object.
     * Now, in the credential controller, we now which operation is being done on the credential object itself (based on type of HTTP request, POST or PUT),
     * but regardless the type of credential operation, each credential can be linked to a new user (means we would have and insert operation for it) or be linked to existing user (means we would have update operation for user).
     * In that case we need to indicate how user object should be validated, with InsertValidationGroup or UpdateValidationGroup and as we said, it's independent of type of credential operation.
     * For handling this kind of use-cases, we use this validation group.
